I recently finished the book "Thinking in Systems" which is IMHO one of the best reads I've ever encountered. Being not entirely new to Systems thinking, many of the topics and thinking patterns were already present to me.

> You’ll be thinking not in terms of a static world, but a dynamic one. You’ll stop looking for who’s to blame; instead you’ll start asking, “What’s the system?” The concept of feedback opens up the idea that a system can cause its own behavior.

## System traps and oppurtunities.

> Being less surprised by complex systems is mainly a matter of learning to expect, appreciate, and use the world’s complexity.

One main concept discussed in this book are system traps, common patterns of archetypes of diseases relying in the systemic behavior and its structure and feedback loops.

> Understanding archetypal problem-generating structures is not enough. Putting up with them is impossible. They need to be changed. The destruction they cause is often blamed on particular actors or events, although it is actually a consequence of system structure. Blaming, disciplining, firing, twisting policy levers harder, hoping for a more favorable sequence of driving events, tinkering at the margins— these standard responses will not fix structural problems. That is why I call these archetypes “traps.”

That reminds us why e.g. Post Portems and generally our thinking, must be blameless. **There is no blame.** I notice that more and more in my life that I feel a bit angry or at least unwohl every time I hear about someone blaming another one. 
  
 > But system traps can be escaped— by recognizing them in advance and not getting caught in them, or by altering the structure— by reformulating goals, by weakening, strengthening, or altering feedback loops, by adding new feedback loops. That is why I call these archetypes not just traps, but opportunities.
 
Escaping system traps is not easy, but worth it because root causes will be fixed, not only symptoms.

Policy Resistance / Fixes that fail

> Policy resistance comes from the bounded rationalities of the actors in a system, each with his or her (or “its” in the case of an institution) own goals. Each actor monitors the state of the system with regard to some important variable— income or prices or housing or drugs or investment— and compares that state with his, her, or its goal. If there is a discrepancy, each actor does something to correct the situation. Usually the greater the discrepancy between the goal and the actual situation, the more emphatic the action will be.
  
 > One way to deal with policy resistance is to try to overpower it. If you wield enough power and can keep wielding it, the power approach can work, at the cost of monumental resentment and the possibility of explosive consequences if the power is ever let up.
